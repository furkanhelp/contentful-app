## About The Project
The Contentful App is a web application designed to showcase the power of integrating modern content management systems with React. Built with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, the app retrieves and displays content dynamically from Contentful, a headless CMS platform. This project serves as both a practical tool for managing and presenting content seamlessly and a demonstration of leveraging APIs to build responsive and scalable applications. The clean design and smooth functionality reflect the potential of combining React's robust framework with third-party integrations like Contentful.

<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

- JavaScript

## What I learned
While building the Contentful App, I gained a deeper understanding of integrating third-party content management systems into modern web applications. This project enhanced my skills in working with APIs, managing dynamic content, and optimizing user interfaces for a seamless experience. Additionally, deploying the application to Netlify taught me valuable lessons in continuous deployment and hosting. It was a rewarding experience that combined backend integrations with front-end design, further solidifying my React.js and project management abilities.
