## About The Project
This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills. There's a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu, but the focus is HTML & CSS.
The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

## What I learned
While building the Contentful App, I gained a deeper understanding of integrating third-party content management systems into modern web applications. This project enhanced my skills in working with APIs, managing dynamic content, and optimizing user interfaces for a seamless experience. Additionally, deploying the application to Netlify taught me valuable lessons in continuous deployment and hosting. It was a rewarding experience that combined backend integrations with front-end design, further solidifying my React.js and project management abilities.
